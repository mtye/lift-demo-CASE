 * Notes for Step 0

The pom.xml file and the contents of the src directory were generated by Maven
using the following command:

  mvn archetype:generate -U -DarchetypeGroupId=net.liftweb \
                            -DarchetypeArtifactId=lift-archetype-basic \
                            -DarchetypeVersion=2.0-M3

And specifying:

  "com.marktye"      for the groupId,
  "lift-demo-CASE"   for the artifactId,
  "1.0-SNAPSHOT"     for the version, and
  "com.marktye.rhcp" for the package.

The Maven-generated web application can be compiled and executed with the
command:

  mvn jetty:run


 * Notes for Step 1

As a precursor to developing the Giveaway application, some of the artifacts
generated by the Maven archetype were deleted or changed.

The application does not serve any static files, so the "static" directory
under src/main/webapp was deleted, along with the corresponding menu entry in
the Boot.scala file.
